This is an implementation of the Save the Universe RPG rules for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

So far, this project supports character sheets for heroes and for supporting characters, and can manage dice rolls when resolving actions. More features (and fixes for any bugs) will be available as the project progresses.

The full rules for the game are available here: https://dbisdorf.itch.io/save-the-universe

To create a hero:
- Create a new Actor, using the "hero" type.
- Open the "Roles" compendium folder. Drag your desired role into the character sheet for your new hero.
- Customize as desired.

You can also create a supporting character by creating a new Actor with the "supporting" type.

To use the Galactic Information templates:
- Open the "Galactic Information" compendium folder.
- Right-click on the template you want to use, and select "Import" from the pop-up window.
- A copy of the template will now be in your journal entries. Open it up and customize it.

To resolve an action:
- In your hero's character sheet, click on the name of the appropriate action.
- A pop-up dialog will appear, showing you which die results will pass and which will fail, based on your hero's attributes.
- If you're relying on your hero's expertise or your ship, or if you received help, check those boxes.
- Click the "Roll" button.
- The results will appear in the chat log. You'll see whether the dice passed or failed, and why, as well as the overall result.
